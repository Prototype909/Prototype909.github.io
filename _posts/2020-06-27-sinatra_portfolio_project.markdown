Just finished the Sinatra project, feels good to have that done!!

I build a simple website that users could perform CRUD actions on a film database.

This was a really fun project and I got a lot out of it. I feel 100% more confident in my ability to code and understand what I am writing and what it is doing then I ever did during the CLI project; I wonder if i went back if it would be so much clearier now?

One of the main gains in learning is debugging. I was able to see things in TUX that allowed me to understand what it was, or was not doing. In additon, my use of PRY has come along and my ability to read what it is displaying had gained ground.

One major take-away from this project is seeing the logic flow. Seeing the code flow is becoming so much clearing now!

If i have to think of challanges regarding the project it would have to be the authorizations while using sessions. Rember your id's folks!!

Overall building an working website was extreamly exciting! It was fun to show it off to my roommate and to actually understand what is happening behind the scenes.
