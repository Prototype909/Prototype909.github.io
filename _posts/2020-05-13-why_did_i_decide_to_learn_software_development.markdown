I have always had a passion for tech, whether its at the user level or hardware, its always facinated me. That, coupled with a personality that is eager to explore, to learn, to invent or create, seemed like a good reason to explore this career path. As I mentioned, Im inspired by how technology is changing the world, and its exciting to think that I could learn to  be a part of that changing word by creating and being part of building software applications, etc.
