This Project is special in the sence that it is my final portfolio project. Its hard to believe that I am finaly here at the end of this program, looking back it was quite a journey. One thing i have learn during my time and with this project is that I am not afriat to jump in and investigate, and play around with code, becuase I know that failing, trying, testing, etc. is all part of the process. And what a process this project was. I want to  mention that this project is the second attempt at the React/Redux portfolio project. My first attemp was the grandiose idea of building a recipe book. My first attempt was really flexing and showing off everything I learned and the project quickly becaome huge. There was user signup and signin, thrid party authentication, sessions, comments, likes, etc. Things with the first project was looking really good, but i ran into a few bugs at the end that i just couldn't figure out. Even some professional Dev friends of mine got stumped! So I decided to put that on the backburner and finish it up at a later date. I started over after two weeks into the project and made a really simple verson that just met project requiremets.

The project is a simple recipe book where someone can add a recipe title, a ingredient and preperation instructions as well as a image link for tha recipe. 

The back end is simple, only one table that takes in a string of title, text and image link,. I only have one recipe model that validates the title, text and image link. A simple serializer for the same attributes as well as a recie controller that housed an index, create, and show method.
